# 📘 Introduction to Programming

A **programming language** is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine (particularly a computer) to perform specific tasks.  
These instructions form what is called a **computer program**.

## 💻 List of Programming Languages

- **JavaScript** → Web development  
  - Frameworks/Tools: React Native (Mobile apps for iOS & Android), Electron (Desktop apps)  
- **Python** → General-purpose & backend  
  - Frameworks: Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.  
- **C** → Low-level, system programming  
- **C#** → Application development, .NET ecosystem  
- **C++** → Performance-critical apps, game engines  
- **Java** → Enterprise apps, mobile (Android)  
  - Frameworks: Spring Boot, etc.  
- **Assembly** → Hardware-level programming  
- **Ruby** → Web development (Ruby on Rails)  
- **PHP** → Web backend  
  - Frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, etc.  
- **SQL** → Databases (**Structured Query Language**)  
- **Go (Golang)** → Concurrent, fast backend services  
- **Swift** → iOS/macOS development  
- **Objective-C** → Legacy Apple apps  
- **Perl** → Text processing, scripting  
- **Haskell** → Functional programming  
- **Scala** → JVM + functional programming  
- **Kotlin** → Android apps, modern JVM language  
- **Rust** → Memory-safe systems programming  
- **Flutter** → Cross-platform app development (uses Dart)  
- **Dart** → Language for Flutter apps  
- **TypeScript** → JavaScript with types  
- **Lua** → Lightweight scripting (games, embedded)  
- **Nim** → Systems + application programming

## 🗂️ Notes
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is not a general-purpose programming language but is essential for working with **databases**.
